# Contributing to NotificationEngine

First of all i'd like to thank you for considering contributing to **NotificationEngine**!  
This project is my first real, serious, and structured project. It's hence always open to improvements, fixes and new ideas. Here’s how you can help us all:

---

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs
- Use the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) page.
- Describe clearly the bug, steps to reproduce, and your system (OS, Godot version).
- Screenshots or example projects are welcome.

---

## ✨ Suggesting Features
- Open an issue with the `feature request` label.
- Explain *why* the feature is useful, not just *what* it does.
- Keep scope realistic: this plugin should stay lightweight and easy to integrate.

---

## 🔧 Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
   ```

2. Make your changes:
   - Follow Godot’s GDScript style (tabs for indent, spaces around `:` and `=`, comments in English).
   - Keep code clean and documented.
   - Test changes with the included demo scene.

3. Commit with a clear message:

   ```
   git commit -m "Add: support for custom themes in payload"
   ```

4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request.

## 🧪 Testing
- Always run the **demo scene** to ensure notifications display and stack correctly.
- Check both alignments (bottom-left, bottom-right).
- Test with/without icons, actions, and themes.
